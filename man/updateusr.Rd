\title{Updates the 'usr' coordinates in the current plot.}
\description{For a traditional graphics plot this function will update the 'usr'
coordinates by transforming a pair of points from the current usr
coordinates to those specified.}
\usage{updateusr(x1, y1 = NULL, x2, y2 = NULL)}
\arguments{
  \item{x1}{The x-coords of 2 points in the current 'usr' coordinates, or anything that can be passed to \code{xy.coords}.}
  \item{y1}{The y-coords of 2 points in the current 'usr' coordinates, or an object representing the points in the new 'usr' coordinates.}
  \item{x2}{The x-coords for the 2 points in the new coordinates.}
  \item{y2}{The y-coords for the 2 points in the new coordinates.}
}
\details{Sometimes graphs (in the traditional graphing scheme) end up with usr
coordinates different from expected for adding to the plot (for
example \code{barplot} does not center the bars at integers).  This
function will take 2 points in the current 'usr' coordinates and the
desired 'usr' coordinates of the 2 points and transform the user
coordinates to make this happen.  The updating only shifts and scales
the coordinates, it does not do any rotation or warping transforms.

If \code{x1} and \code{y1} are lists or matricies and \code{x2} and
\code{y2} are not specified, then \code{x1} is taken to be the
coordinates in the current system and \code{y1} is the coordinates in
the new system.

Currently you need to give the function exactly 2 points in each
system.  The 2 points cannot have the same x values or y values in
either system.}
\value{An invisible list with the previous 'usr' coordinates from \code{par}.}

\note{Currently you need to give coordinates for exactly 2 points without
missing values.  Future versions of the function will allow missing
values or multiple points.
