Changes in Version 1.2.0

  o As of version: 1.2.0, RgoogleMaps only offers support for png files, no more jpeg.

  Changes in Version 1.4.1

  o new feature: added full support for OpenStreetMap maps

  Changes in Version 1.5.1 
    o removed dependency on maptools: the respective examples in PlotPolysOnStaticMap were removed
    o removed dependency on sp: (i) functions DF2SpatialPointsDataFrame and bubblemap were entirely removed, (ii) copied sp::bbox into a new sp_bbox function, (iii) replaced xy = sp::coordinates(xy) in SpatialToPBS.R with xy = xy@coords, (iv) replaced data sets with sp classes with sf: NYleukemia$spatial.polygon = st_as_sf(NYleukemia$spatial.polygon), pennLC$spatial.polygon = st_as_sf(pennLC$spatial.polygon)
